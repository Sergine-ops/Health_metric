The Global Health Metric Dashboard is an interactive web application built with Dash that allows users to visualize and analyze various health indicators across multiple countries over time. Users can select countries, choose specific health metrics (such as Life Expectancy, Infant Mortality, and Access to Healthcare), and adjust the year range using an intuitive interface. The dashboard generates dynamic visualizations, including bar and scatter plots, to help users understand trends and comparisons in health data. Additionally, users can download the underlying data in CSV format for further analysis.
