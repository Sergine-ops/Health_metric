This project is a Dash-based web application that visualizes global health metrics, such as life expectancy, infant mortality, access to healthcare, and disease prevalence across various countries. Users can select countries, indicators, and time ranges to generate interactive graphs, with the option to download the displayed data. The app uses Bootstrap for a clean and responsive design.
